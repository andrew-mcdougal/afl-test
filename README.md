# Front End Developer coding task

Table of player data populated with JSON data.

### Installation

To view the table follow these steps:

1. Download the project ZIP file here: [Github afl-test ZIP](https://github.com/andrew-mcdougal/afl-test/archive/master.zip)

2. Open the ZIP file

3. Open the file "afl-table-01.html" in a web browser

4. The table will display as requested

Note: if the above instructions do not work you can view the table by [clicking this link](http://ontrendwebsites.com/afl-test/afl-table-01.html){:target="_blank"}


## Alternate version

I have created an alternate version of the table. After a few seconds a button will slide up from the bottom of the page. Click this once you have reviewed the original table.

To go back to viewing the original table simply refresh your browser.

The alternate version is included for these reasons:

* I like to offer design and functionality suggestions when I feel it may contribute to the UX
* Showing other coding skills and languages I use regularly in my work
* This table version is responsive to smaller devices
*Â Offering a different design to the original using the AFL corporate colours and a different, larger font.

## Notes

"Collingwood" was spelt incorrectly in the JSON file, I have left it as is.

I found the team logos on afl.com.au that were used in the code example.
